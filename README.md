A Haskell-based attempt to replicate X,Y color desaturation from chromaCalc



```Original Color:
x: 0.54
y: 0.362

White Point:
x: 0.345
y: 0.352

Desaturation Factor (alpha): 0.75

Scaled Original Color:
x: 0.405
y: 0.27149999999999996

Scaled White Point:
x: 8.625e-2
y: 8.8e-2

Desaturated Color:
x: 0.49125
y: 0.35949999999999993```

However, chromaCalc gives me the following answer:

Desaturated Color:
x: 0.493
y: 0.35949999999999993
